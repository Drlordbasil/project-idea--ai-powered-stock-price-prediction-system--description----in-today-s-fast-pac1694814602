# Step 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing
# Assuming historical stock price data is available in a CSV file named 'stock_data.csv'

df = pd.read_csv('stock_data.csv')
# Preprocess the data, handle missing values, clean the data, etc.

# Step 2: Feature Engineering
# Create technical indicators, perform sentiment analysis, integrate macroeconomic data, etc.

# Step 3: Model Training and Evaluation
# Split the data into training and testing sets
X = df.drop('target_column', axis=1)  # Replace 'target_column' with the actual target column name
y = df['target_column']  # Replace 'target_column' with the actual target column name
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train different models and evaluate their performance
model_lr = LinearRegression()
model_svr = SVR()
model_rf = RandomForestRegressor()

model_lr.fit(X_train, y_train)
model_svr.fit(X_train, y_train)
model_rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 4: Real-time Prediction
# Assuming user inputs a stock symbol and the model predicts the stock price

user_input = input("Enter a stock symbol: ")
# Use the model to generate short-term and long-term predictions based on user input

# Step 5: Visualization and Reporting
# Visualize historical and predicted stock prices, provide confidence intervals, trend analysis, etc.
# Use libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn

# Step 6: Deployment and Integration
# Build a user-friendly interface or REST API to allow seamless integration into other applications, trading bots, etc.
